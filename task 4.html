                <h3>Project 1:Student Report Card</h3>
                <p>This project aims to develop a modern digital report card system for students. It will provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and understanding academic performance data. The student report card project in C++ is to create a system that allows users to input and store student information, including grades and other relevant data, and generate report cards or summaries of their academic performance based on this information..</p>
                <h3>Project 2:Billing System</h3>
                <p>This project will only work to generate the bill. When you will run this project, first of all you will have to enter the names of all the products which you have bought. After this you have to press the y key after which the project will calculate the total price of all the products based on the price of the product you have bought. And then your bill will be generated and printed . Now we know the main function and user defined function used in this project, what work they will do, we have done the coding to get the work done inside these functions.
